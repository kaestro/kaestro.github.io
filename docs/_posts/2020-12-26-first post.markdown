Though I know this would seem a bit dirty, because the blog has "TESTPAGE" on the right upper corner, and this is written in English, why do you still have welcome-to-jekyll page, and so on.

Well, I've been quite busy for having some interviews.
 I've been to many junior job opening interviews like NAVER, SK C&C, Ahn Lab, and so on.
 Actually, I was a crew of Ahnlab for a day.
 But anyway.

By the way, the reason I'm writing this material is because, my visual studio code seems not to properly support Korean writing and that's all.
 Maybe I'll shift to writing these posts down from chrome browser, but that's another day's story.

Anyway, for more than 2 months of days have passed, I finally write down the first post of my own.

To tell about what's going to be the posts for right now, I'm thinking of joining Java study of 'Baek gi seon'.
 So the next post will be, and hoping, posted in 7 days about the week's guide from him.

 Also, I would like to post some of the things I've done with the algorithm study I've held last week. 
 They seem to be nice people, but for this is my first time opening this kind of session, I don't know whether it will work or not.

 To set a goal, I'm thinking of attaining google kickstart but that's the story of tomorrows.
